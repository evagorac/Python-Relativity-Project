# Relativity
A short project for my Modern Physics class which accepts coordinates, draws a line between adjacent coordinates, and shows the effects of special relativity to an outside observer.  This program accounts for length contraction as well as the finite speed of light, so what you see in the program is what an observer would actually see in real life.
